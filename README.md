# MentorShip

MentorShip is a website that aims to bridge the gap between fresh graduates like us and experienced industry mentors.

## Inspiration

I got this idea when I was on my job hunt, I have applied over hundred of jobs and only got one interview and has a very hard time looking for a mentor(Still no luck), that was when an idea pop into my head. I could build a website like Stack overflow but the website is for those developer who need new ideas and for those who is having a hard time to find a mentor or a partner to build projects with.
